# Product Guidelines - Zero

## Design Principles
- **Balanced Density & Clarity:** The interface must support high information density for power users while maintaining visual clarity through precise typography and deliberate use of white space to prevent cognitive overload.
- **Modern Professional Aesthetic:** A "pro" look achieved through a monochrome palette (blacks, whites, and grays) punctuated by a single, vibrant accent color for primary actions and key highlights.
- **Clean Foundations:** Standardized use of modern sans-serif typography (Geist) and minimal, line-based iconography (Lucide).

## User Experience & Interaction
- **Professional & Concise Tone:** All application copy and AI interactions must be direct, objective, and efficient, avoiding unnecessary fluff or conversational filler.
- **Keyboard-First Flow:** While maintaining standard usability, the interface should feel optimized for rapid, keyboard-driven navigation and action execution.
- **Transparent State:** 
    - Use non-intrusive toasts for background process feedback.
    - Implement in-line loading states (skeletons/spinners) to maintain perceived speed.
    - Always require explicit confirmation for destructive actions like permanent deletion.

## Accessibility
- **Pragmatic Usability:** Focus on high usability for the general user base, addressing specific accessibility barriers and screen reader improvements iteratively as they are identified.
