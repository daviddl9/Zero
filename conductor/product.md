# Product Definition - Zero

## Initial Concept
Zero is an open-source AI email solution that gives users the power to self-host their own email app while also integrating external services like Gmail and other email providers. Our goal is to modernize and improve emails through AI agents to truly modernize emails.

## Target Audience
- **Developers:** Those seeking an extensible, open-source platform that can be customized and integrated into broader technical workflows.
- **SMB Organizations:** Small to medium-sized organizations requiring a secure, self-hosted email solution to maintain data sovereignty.

## Core Value Proposition
Zero provides the privacy and control of a self-hosted solution combined with the advanced capabilities of modern AI. It targets power users and developers who find current solutions either too restrictive, privacy-invasive, or lacking in modern automation capabilities.

## Key Features
- **Core Email Management:** Full suite of functionality for sending, receiving, and organizing emails.
- **AI-Powered Intelligence:** Integration of Agents and LLMs for summarization, smart replies, proactive assistance, and autonomous email drafting.
- **Unified Inbox:** A single interface to manage multiple providers including Gmail and Outlook.
- **Self-Hosting First:** Designed for easy deployment and management on private infrastructure.
- **Extensible API:** A robust developer API and plugin system for building custom integrations.
- **Smart Automations:** Advanced automation engine triggered by incoming emails to streamline workflows.

## Email Automations
The automation engine allows users to create rules that respond to incoming mail:
- **Triggers:** Supports conditions based on sender/domain, keyword matching in subjects/bodies, and AI-powered intent detection (e.g., identifying "urgent" or "invoices").
- **Actions:** Initial support for automatic labeling and categorization to keep the inbox organized without manual effort.

## User Experience Goals
- **Minimalist & Fast:** Zero prioritizes speed and efficiency, utilizing a clutter-free interface and heavy reliance on keyboard shortcuts to enable a "flow state" for email management.
